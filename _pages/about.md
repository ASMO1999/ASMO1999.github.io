Hi, my name is Asbjørn Mortensen. I have a diploma in Mechanical Engineering with specializations in Integrated Product and Production Development, as well as a business specialization. My areas of interest include mechatronics, automation, CAD design and documentation, manufacturing, and fabrication. I enjoy being part of a project from the early stages—identifying product needs, designing and testing solutions, to finally handing over the product to the customer. In addition to my business specialization, I worked as an academic researcher at Aarhus University, and later full-time for several months. During this time, I was responsible for designing, constructing, and testing a deep-water sonde using several gas sensors. This project was my first professional role in engineering, where I gained valuable experience in communication with internal and external partners.

My interest in engineering stems from growing up on a farm, where I've been tinkering with and repairing machinery and buildings since childhood. In my spare time, I enjoy watching or playing football, spending time with family and friends, or helping on the farm, which often involves repairing various machines.

This website is an ongoing for fun project started the 20th October, and changes and updates will be made continuously
